This is\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n *\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *    CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             FlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    this.$Dispatcher_callbacks = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isPending = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isHandled = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isDispatching = false;\n    this.$Dispatcher_pendingPayload = null;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.

For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = _react2.default.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n\n  propTypes: {\n    afterElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    afterStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n    beforeStyle: _react2.default.PropTypes.object,\n    children: _react2.default.PropTypes.node,\n    elementType: _react2.default.PropTypes.string,\n\n    /**\n     * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n     */\n    style: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  contextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  childContextTypes: {\n    muiTheme: _react2.default.PropTypes.object\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.context.muiTheme || (0, _getMuiTheme2.default)()\n    };\n  },\n  getChildContext: function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      muiTheme: this.state.muiTheme\n    };\n  },\n  componentWillReceiveProps: function componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) {\n    this.setState({\n      muiTheme: nextContext.muiTheme || this.state.muiTheme\n    });\n  },\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var prepareStyles = this.state.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n    var beforeElement = void 0;\n    var afterElement = void 0;\n\n    if (beforeStyle) {\n      beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n        key: '::before'\n      });\n    }\n\n    if (afterStyle) {\n      afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n        style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n        key: '::after'\n      });\n    }\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n    return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n});\n\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 554\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _simpleAssign = require('simple-assign');\n\nvar _simpleAssign2 = _interopRequireDefault(_simpleAssign);\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _paper = require('../paper');\n\nvar _paper2 = _interopRequireDefault(_paper);\n\nvar _transitions = require('../styles/transitions');\n\nvar _transitions2 = _interopRequireDefault(_transitions);\n\nvar _getMuiTheme = require('../styles/getMuiTheme');\n\nvar _getMuiTheme2 = _interopRequireDefault(_getMuiTheme);\n\nvar _propTypes = require('../utils/prop-types');\n\nvar _propTypes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_propTypes);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\nfunction getStyles(props, state) {\n  var targetOrigin = props.targetOrigin;\n  var open = state.open;\n  var zIndex = state.muiTheme.zIndex;\n\n\n  var horizontal = targetOrigin.horizontal.replace('middle', 'vertical');\n\n  return {\n    root: {\n      opacity: open ? 1 : 0,\n      transform: open ?
